## 🌂 Why Umbrella?

Every mainstream wallet and exchange wants your passport, your face, your phone — and then keeps your coins on **their** servers. When they freeze, get hacked, or simply decide you're "suspicious", your money stops being yours. 🧊

Umbrella flips that model:

- 🕵️ **Truly anonymous.** Install and go. There is no registration screen, because there is nothing to register. Nothing in the app identifies you.
- 🔑 **You hold the keys.** Your 24-word recovery phrase is created on *your* computer and never leaves it. Not to us, not to anyone. We literally *cannot* touch your funds — that's the point.
- 🧅 **Tor built in.** Flip one switch and the wallet's traffic goes through the Tor network — no separate install, no configuration. Your IP stays out of your finances.
- 🥷 **Secrets that can't be screenshotted.** While your recovery phrase is on screen, the window renders black to screen-capture and remote-viewing software.
- 💸 **Real money movement.** Send and receive Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Solana, **TON**, TRON, USDT and Monero — to any wallet or exchange in the world. Transactions are signed on your machine; only the signed result ever goes out. TON transfers are pinned byte-for-byte against the reference `@ton` library, so a wrong byte can never strand funds.
- 📈 **Live market, real candles.** A built-in market with **real OHLC candlestick charts** (Binance klines) and live prices (CoinGecko) — timeframes from 1H to 1Y. No mock data anywhere.
- 🎨 **Yours to look at.** Eleven colour themes, six interface languages, movable navigation, and full **profile customization** — your own avatar, banner and sidebar/lock-screen backgrounds, plus premium motion (glassy cards, a floating dock, a parallax hero). A private wallet doesn't have to feel like a tax form.

## ⚔️ Umbrella vs. the usual suspects

| | ☂️ Umbrella | 🏦 Exchange app | 👛 Typical wallet |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Sign-up / KYC | ❌ none | 🪪 passport + selfie | 📧 often email |
| Who holds the keys | 🫵 you | 🏢 them | 🫵 you |
| Can freeze your funds | ❌ impossible | ✅ any time | ❌ |
| Tor anonymity | ✅ one switch | ❌ | ⚠️ manual setup |
| Monero support | ✅ full wallet | ⚠️ delisting it | ❌ rare |
| Screenshot-proof seed | ✅ | — | ❌ |
| Tracks you | ❌ zero analytics | ✅ extensively | ⚠️ usually |
| Price | 🆓 | "free" (you're the product) | 🆓 |

## 💼 What you can do

| | |
|---|---|
| 📥 **Receive** | One tap shows a QR + address for any coin. Colour-coded so you never receive on the wrong network. |
| 📤 **Send** | To any address or exchange deposit. Clear review step, economical fees by default. |
| 👁️ **Watch** | Track any public address (your Ledger, an old MetaMask) without ever importing a key. |
| 🏦 **Link exchanges** | See your Binance, Bybit, OKX, Kraken, KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, Bitget and Telegram CryptoBot balances beside your on-chain coins — via **read-only** keys that can't move funds. |
| 📊 **Follow the market** | Real candles, five time windows (1H → 1Y), auto-refresh — for every listed coin. |
| 💾 **Back up** | One click exports an encrypted backup file. Useless to a thief, priceless to future-you. |
| 🔐 **Lock** | Auto-locks after idle. `Ctrl+L` locks instantly. |

## 📦 Download

| Platform | Package | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Windows** | [`UmbrellaWallet-2.2.0-win-x64-portable.zip`](https://github.com/kiurakku/umbrella-wallet/releases/latest/download/UmbrellaWallet-2.2.0-win-x64-portable.zip) | Portable — unzip and run `Umbrella.Wallet.App.exe` |
| **Linux** | [`UmbrellaWallet-2.1.4-linux-x64.tar.gz`](https://github.com/kiurakku/umbrella-wallet/releases/latest/download/UmbrellaWallet-2.1.4-linux-x64.tar.gz) | Unpack, run `./Umbrella.Wallet.App` — no install required |

## 🚀 Get started

1. ⬇️ **Windows** — download the portable zip, unzip, run `Umbrella.Wallet.App.exe`.
2. 🐧 **Linux** — grab the tar.gz build, unpack, run `./Umbrella.Wallet.App`.
3. 🌐 **Web** — the browser version keeps your phrase in the browser; the server only ever sees *public* data.
4. 🖊️ Create a wallet → **write the 24 words on paper** → done. You now have a bank in your pocket that answers to no one.

> ✍️ **The 24 words ARE the wallet.** Anyone who has them has your money; if you lose them and your device, nobody in the universe can bring your coins back — including us. That is what "your keys" costs, and what it's worth.

## ❓ FAQ

<details><summary><b>💰 Is it really free?</b></summary><br/>
Yes. Download, use, send, receive — free. The license reserves the right to add a small, clearly-disclosed service fee to certain in-app transactions in the future; if that ever happens, you'll see it on the review screen before you confirm anything.
</details>

<details><summary><b>🔍 Can you see my balance or transactions?</b></summary><br/>
No. There is no server of ours holding your data. The app reads public blockchains directly (through Tor if you enable it), and your keys never leave your device. We can't see you, and we like it that way.
</details>

<details><summary><b>😱 I forgot my password / lost my phrase. Can you help?</b></summary><br/>
With the 24 words — yes, you can restore everything on any device, yourself. Without them — nobody can, and that includes us. That's not a policy, it's mathematics.
</details>

<details><summary><b>🏦 Can I move coins from Binance / another wallet here?</b></summary><br/>
Yes. Open <i>Receive</i>, pick the coin, and withdraw from the exchange to the shown address — mind the network (e.g. USDT must come over TRON/TRC-20). Or import an existing wallet's 12/24-word phrase directly.
</details>

<details><summary><b>🕶️ Why is Monero special here?</b></summary><br/>
Most wallets show XMR at best as "receive only". Umbrella ships Monero's own wallet engine inside the app, so XMR is a full coin: real balance, real private sending, keys never leaving your machine.
</details>

<details><summary><b>🧅 Do I need to install Tor?</b></summary><br/>
No — it's inside the app. One switch in <i>Settings → Privacy & Tor</i>, and the wallet's traffic goes through the Tor network on a private port that won't clash with a Tor Browser you already run.
</details>

## 🛠️ For builders

<details>
<summary>Build from source (click to expand)</summary>

**Desktop** (.NET 8 + Avalonia):

```bash
cd desktop
dotnet run --project src/Umbrella.Wallet.App/Umbrella.Wallet.App.csproj   # run
dotnet test                                                               # 77 tests, crypto pinned to published vectors
```

Windows release: `./scripts/fetch-tor.ps1`, `./scripts/fetch-monero.ps1`, then `dotnet publish -r win-x64`.
Linux release: `./scripts/publish-linux.sh` (fetches Linux Tor/Monero helpers, packs a tar.gz).

**Web** (React + NestJS):

```bash
npm install && npm run dev                        # frontend
cd backend && npm install && npm run start:dev    # backend
```

**Security internals:** 256-bit seed from the OS CSPRNG → BIP39 · vault encrypted with Argon2id (64 MiB) + AES-256-GCM · Monero keys go only to the local audited `monero-wallet-rpc` · Tor Expert Bundle on a private SOCKS port · backups exported still-encrypted.

## ⚠️ The honest part

Umbrella is **non-custodial**. That word means: *we never hold your money, so we can never lose it, freeze it — or recover it.* You are the bank now. 🏦 Guard your phrase, check addresses before sending, start with a small test amount. Crypto transactions are final; there is no undo button anywhere in the world. The software is provided as-is, without warranty — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Nothing here is financial advice.
