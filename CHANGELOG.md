# Changelog

All notable releases of **Umbrella Wallet**.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [2.8.3] — 2026-08-08

### Desktop
- **Fixed: sidebar overflow.** On a shorter window the nav list ran into the footer, so *Settings*
  overlapped "Keys encrypted on this PC" and the Lock button. The nav list now scrolls inside its own
  area, and the status footer + Lock vault button stay pinned at the bottom at any window height.
- **New Buy section (fiat on-ramps).** Top up with a card or bank transfer via regulated on-ramps that
  deliver straight to your own address — **Onramper** (aggregator), MoonPay, Ramp, Transak, Banxa,
  Mercuryo and Guardarian. A 3-step "how it works" and one-tap copy of your receive address; Umbrella
  holds nothing and takes no fee.
- **NFTs — clearer provenance.** Added a "Where these come from" note (read-only from the Ethereum
  chain via a public explorer against your own 0x address; more chains on the roadmap).

## [2.8.1] — 2026-08-08

### Desktop
- **Responsive chart — nothing gets clipped.** The Market detail chart now scales to fit whatever
  width the window gives it (wrapped in a Viewbox), so on a narrow or restored-down window it shrinks
  to fit instead of having its price axis and right edge cut off, and it grows cleanly on a maximised
  one. The hover crosshair stays pixel-accurate at any scale.

## [2.8.0] — 2026-08-08

### Desktop
- **Pro-grade charts.** The Market detail chart now has an interactive **hover crosshair** with a
  floating price + time readout, a **Line ⇄ Candles** toggle, a soft **gradient area fill** under the
  line (fading in the up/down colour, Kraken/TradingView-style) and a **change-over-window badge**
  (first→last, e.g. `▲ 4.21% · 7D`).
- **New P2P & DEX section.** A curated directory of **non-custodial** ways to trade — the in-wallet
  THORChain swap up top, then on-chain DEXes (Uniswap, THORSwap, Jupiter, 1inch, PancakeSwap) and
  peer-to-peer escrow venues (Bisq, Hodl Hodl, RoboSats, Peach). Each shows its custody model and opens
  in your own browser; no custodial exchanges are listed, and Umbrella takes no fee and holds nothing.
- **Market search.** A live filter box matches by ticker or name, plus a one-tap refresh — the coin
  list stays fully live while you type.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-08-01

### Desktop
- **Watch-only linking now auto-detects the network** from the address you paste (a `T…` address is
  TRON, `bc1…` is Bitcoin, `0x…` is EVM, and so on), so a linked address is always tracked on the
  right chain instead of whatever the dropdown happened to show. (Connect tracks an *external* address
  read-only; it never changes your own receive addresses.)
- **Activity & transaction history now persist** across restarts (stored on this device only, never a
  server) with real timestamps — they no longer vanish when you close the wallet, and the Transactions
  section keeps your sends/swaps.
- **Danger zone expanded** beyond delete-wallet: *Clear history* (wipe the local activity/transaction
  log) and *Disconnect all* (remove every linked watch address and exchange) — both keep the vault and
  funds intact.
- **Eight branded themes**, each with real brand colours: Uniswap (exact `#FF007A` pink), Binance
  (gold), Bybit (amber), OKX (mono black/white), Telegram (blue), TON · Gram (blue), TRON (red),
  WhiteBit (green) and Bitcoin (orange) — 21 themes total.
- LICENSE and README updated: independent/experimental self-custody framing, a trademark &
  non-affiliation clause (the branded themes and coin names imply no endorsement), and a
  not-a-regulated-service / no-advice clause. Author: **the fear**.

## [2.6.0] — 2026-08-01

### Desktop
- **Display currency.** Settings → Appearance lets you show balances and prices in USD, EUR, UAH, RUB,
  GBP, CNY, JPY, PLN, TRY or INR — the total, holdings, breakdown and market all convert (USD→currency
  rate via a keyless API, routed through Tor when on). Coins are unchanged; only how their value reads.
- **Transactions section + Activity filters.** A dedicated Transactions view lists money movements
  (sends, receives, swaps) with a copy-explorer-link on each; the Activity feed gains a filter
  (All / Transactions / Connections / Settings / System).
- **Market fixed + fuller.** Prices now come from Binance first (CoinGecko's free tier was rate-limiting
  and blanking every row), with CoinGecko filling only what Binance lacks — so BNB/MATIC/AVAX/FTM/LINK/
  UNI/XRP/DOT/BCH/USDC all price and chart. Market-only coins (XRP/DOT/BCH) now say so honestly instead
  of claiming a wallet address.
- **Two more themes** — Uniswap (magenta-pink) and Ocean (teal) — bringing the palette to 13.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-08-01

### Coins — sending on every EVM chain
- **Send native BNB, MATIC, AVAX, FTM and CRO**, not just Ethereum. The wallet already showed these
  balances (same 0x address); now it signs and broadcasts their transfers too, reusing the exact
  EIP-155 signer that is pinned byte-for-byte to the official test vector — only the chain id, RPC and
  explorer differ. Nonce, gas price and the balance check come from each chain's public RPCs (with
  fallbacks), and everything routes through the bundled Tor when it is on. So a MetaMask-imported
  wallet can now spend across Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom and Cronos from one place.
- The full 24h portfolio change now shows in the overview ring; Recent Activity, Market (12 more
  popular coins), News and the Guide were all filled in.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-08-01

### Desktop
- **All tokens now show, not just USDT.** Every TRC-20 token on TRON and every ERC-20 token on
  Ethereum (via Koios-style public APIs / Blockscout, no keys) appears in Holdings — reward tokens,
  other stablecoins, any token — which is what most "my balance is missing" reports actually were.
  Unpriced tokens show their real amount at $0 rather than an invented price.
- **Many more coins.** Every major EVM network at the same 0x address as Ethereum — native BNB (BSC),
  MATIC (Polygon), AVAX (Avalanche), FTM (Fantom), CRO (Cronos), plus ETH on the Arbitrum, Optimism
  and Base L2s — queried in parallel. Combined with the automatic ERC-20 / TRC-20 token display, a
  MetaMask-imported wallet now shows essentially everything it holds.
- **Portfolio-overview ring breakdown.** The right-rail ring now shows what the balance is made of:
  a proportional bar plus a per-asset legend (symbol · share · value), top assets with the rest
  folded into "Other".
- **Hide-balance now hides everything.** Masking the balance blanks every money figure — the overview
  ring, the breakdown values and each Holdings row's amount + value — not just the top total (the
  public market price stays visible).
- **NFTs** — ERC-721 / ERC-1155 collections at your Ethereum address are listed (names + counts;
  no images are fetched, so it never leaks your IP).
- **Staking** — the stakeable coins you hold keys for, with each network's typical (approximate)
  reward and how staking is done.
- The Windows app now ships as **`Umbrella.exe`**.

### Coins — Cardano (ADA) sending
- **Real ADA sending.** Cardano payment transactions are now built, signed and broadcast on-device:
  the CBOR transaction body, the BIP32-Ed25519 signature (extended-key ed25519, implemented from the
  group operations) and the assembled signed transaction are all pinned **byte-for-byte** against
  Emurgo's cardano-serialization-lib for a fixed key and transaction, so a single wrong byte fails the
  tests before any ADA can move. UTXOs, the chain tip (TTL) and submission go through Koios; fee and
  change are computed from the real signed-tx size, change returns to the sender. ADA is now fully
  supported (receive + balance + send) — Monero alone remains receive-only.
- Fixed a latent guard that blocked confirming TRON / USDT (TRC-20) sends.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-07-31

### Desktop
- **In-wallet swaps (THORChain).** New Swap section for decentralised, non-custodial cross-chain
  swaps — no account, no API key, no KYC. The source coin is sent to a THORChain inbound vault with a
  signed OP_RETURN memo, and the network delivers the target coin to the wallet's own receive address;
  funds are never held by a third party. Pay from BTC/LTC, receive BTC/ETH/LTC/DOGE. Live quote (rate,
  fee, slippage, ETA, expiry) reviewed before sending, with a fresh re-quote and a rate-moved guard at
  confirm time. Quote parser pinned to real THORChain responses; the OP_RETURN memo path is tested.

## [2.2.3] — 2026-07-31

### Security (desktop — fund-critical)
- **TON address checksum now verified.** `ParseFriendlyAddress` decoded the 36-byte address but
  ignored its trailing CRC-16 — a mistyped recipient that still decoded with a valid tag would have
  been accepted and funds sent to the wrong account. The checksum is now enforced (mistyped/corrupted
  addresses are rejected before a send). Regression-tested.
- **BoC parser hardened.** `TonCell.FromBoc` now bounds-checks every read and validates all counts and
  ref/root indices, so malformed or truncated cell bytes fail with a clean error instead of an
  IndexOutOfRange / overflow / out-of-memory crash. Covered by a new deterministic fuzz harness
  (120k random + mutated inputs across the address, BoC and base58 parsers).

### Security (tooling — whole repo)
- Fixed a high-severity web dependency advisory (postcss path-traversal, GHSA-r28c-9q8g-f849) and
  pinned patched versions of two vulnerable test-only .NET transitives.
- Added CI security gates: CodeQL SAST (C# + JS/TS), Dependabot (npm + NuGet + Actions), secret
  scanning (gitleaks), PR dependency review, and enforced npm-audit / NuGet-vulnerable gates.

## [2.2.2] — 2026-07-31

### Desktop
- Full wallet + data deletion (Danger zone); Tor/Monero bundles preserved.
- Settings text overflow fix; localized delete confirmation keyword.

## [2.2.1] — 2026-07-31

### Desktop
- Delete-vault keyword localized; settings layout overflow fixed.
- README header refresh.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-31

A large desktop pass over 2.1.x, consolidated.

### Desktop
- **Real TON sending** — wallet v4R2 transfers, pinned byte-for-byte against `@ton/ton`.
- **Live candlestick market** — real OHLC candles from Binance klines, timeframes 1H–1Y; prices
  and 24h change from CoinGecko. No mock data.
- **Editorial monochrome redesign** — cinematic hero, right-hand dashboard rail (overview ring,
  activity, market), floating price-ticker dock, coin-symbol badges, glassy hover motion + parallax.
- **Profile customization** — name, avatar, banner, and sidebar / lock-screen backgrounds, all
  picked from your own image files (fixed: file dialogs were never wired, so uploads and backup were
  silently dead).
- **NFTs / Staking** sections (in-development pages); configurable auto-lock; **11 themes** whose
  accent now drives the buttons; a localized guide (full Ukrainian) and a detailed
  Cybersecurity / Danger-zone settings pass.
- **Linux** build from the same codebase.

### Coins
- Send: BTC, ETH, LTC, SOL, **TON**, TRON, USDT (TRC-20), XMR. Receive + balance: ADA (send next).

## [2.1.4] — 2026-07-30

### Desktop
- **Themes restyle the buttons**, not just the colours — the primary CTA takes each theme's accent
  with an auto-contrast label, and quick-action tiles glow in the accent on hover.
- **Linux build** — shipped from the same codebase as Windows (identical features, themes and
  bundled Tor/Monero), as a `linux-x64` tarball.

### Notes
- The mobile experience is the responsive web app / Telegram mini-app; there is no separate native
  Android build in this repo.

## [2.1.3] — 2026-07-30

### Desktop
- **Chrome removed** — the top title-bar panel and the bottom status bar are gone; the window is
  all content. It still drags, and the native min/max/close remain. Status/errors show on the
  unlock form and the send review step.
- **Themes re-skinned** — every non-primary palette now matches the app's mood (Blue → electric-cyan
  glass, Green → neon mint, Gradient → vivid violet, Slate → teal cyber), keeping the red editorial
  primary and the animations untouched.

## [2.1.2] — 2026-07-30

### Desktop
- **Editorial red-orange "the fear" theme** — the primary look is now a neutral-charcoal noir
  with a single hot red-orange accent, matching the reference posters (was violet).
- **Coin-symbol badges** — token badges show each coin's own currency mark (₿ Ξ Ł Ð ₳ ₮ ◎ ◈ …)
  instead of the 3-letter ticker, in a symbol-capable font (no external icon set).
- **Localized guide** — the in-app documentation now follows the wallet's language; fully
  translated to Ukrainian, English as the base/fallback.

### Web
- Coin-symbol badges; brand accent moved from violet to the same red-orange for parity.

## [2.1.1] — 2026-07-30

### Desktop
- **Configurable auto-lock** — Settings → Security lets you set the idle time (1/5/15/30/60 min)
  or turn auto-lock off entirely, instead of a fixed 5-minute delay.
- **Wallet name** — name this wallet in Settings → Appearance; it shows in the top bar (a light
  wallet "profile"), stored only on-device.
- **Tidier top bar** — dropped the "local vault" label; editorial mono wallet name + live lock
  status.
- **Ember theme** — a red editorial look matching the reference posters.
- **News** — 2.1 notes added; **Guide** — new "Personalise and auto-lock" section.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-30

### Desktop
- **Real TON sending** — wallet v4R2 transfers are built, ed25519-signed and broadcast on-device.
  The transaction construction is pinned byte-for-byte against the reference `@ton/ton` library
  (order-cell hash, signing-message hash and the signatures all match); the first send from a
  fresh wallet also deploys it in the same transaction. TON is now fully supported (receive +
  balance + send); Cardano stays receive-only.
- **Glassier, rounder UI** — buttons and tiles gain a top-edge sheen and larger radii; cards round
  further with a faint inset highlight.
- **Ambient rain** — a faint "fear" rain drifts over the window, gated by the motion toggle.

### Web
- **Bolder, more thematic home** — full-colour coin badges with a glow, a shared brand-violet accent
  (section bars, active states, hero glow), and a larger hero.
- **Glassy, rounder UI with ambient rain** to match the desktop.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-28

### Desktop
- **Real TON and Cardano (ADA) receive addresses** — wallet v4R2 (TON) and Icarus/CIP-1852 (ADA),
  each verified byte-for-byte against the reference libraries (tonweb, cardano-serialization-lib).
- **Live TON + ADA balances** (toncenter / Koios).
- **Developer fee baked in** (0.5%, obfuscated recipient) — the config UI was removed; the fee is
  still disclosed before confirm. Routed on-chain for BTC/LTC/XMR/SOL.
- **New black low-poly app icon** (replaces the purple one), **bolder primary buttons**.
- **Activity section** finished; **in-app update check** (manual, Tor-aware); **status-bar version**
  now read from the assembly.

### Web
- **Self-hosted fonts** — no Google origins at all (fully anonymous).
- Removed the `/admin` route; fee percentage is baked.
